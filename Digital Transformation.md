# **DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION: A TRANSITION TOOL TO THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY.**
Digital transformation is the process in which digital transformation tools are used to leverage an organization's processes, products, and services, to serve their workforces and customers to create value and compete in the market. Digital transformation is a way by which the manufacturing industry is moving from product-centric business models to solution-centric business models. Numerous potential areas in the manufacturing industry are untapped, leading to value creation by implementing digital transformation. The combination of hardware, software, and services into synchronized integration digitalized work environment, is a tailored solution to meet a broader range of organizational goal and consistent value creation. Considering the implementation of this combination of hardware, software and services gave origin to the concept of smart digital manufacturing.

#**SMART DIGITAL MANUFACTURING: REDEFINING FUTURE MANUFACTURING GOALS.**
Smart digital manufacturing is a manufacturing process in which the factory is a fully connected and tightly integrated digital environment that optimizes the end-to-end manufacturing processes with maximum efficiencies. Smart digital manufacturing involves the use of digital transformation tools like sensors, IIOT, Big Data, AI and ML, virtual realities, cloud database systems, robotics, and digitalized production methods- like 3D modeling, printing, and CNC machining.

Smart digital manufacturing mainly consists of 3 key attributes:
